MOVC A,@A+DPTR	;Indexed addressing
END

Indirect Addressing

RESULT
Various addressing modes have been demonstrated with example programs.
CONCLUSION
We learnt and practically implemented Register , Indexed and Immediate addressing modes. We learnt that in Register addressing a register contains the operand. In Indexed Addressing , we need to specify a base address then use the index to to access individual elements. In Immediate Addressing, the operand has a constant value or an expression. 
REMARKS
Different programs should be written and tested using assembly/C language for better understanding of the tool.
